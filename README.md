==============

Water level simulator.
We have six desalination water plant "RO" whose produced water is stored at a "Storage Tank" inside the production plant, after wich is done the water transfer by electrical pumps to Tanks outside of the production plant and from where the water is distrubuted to citizen's house by gravity.

 This tool (Simulator of Water Transfer and Level Evolution) was made with this sensibility: preventing overfill of fresh-water storage tank that comes from discharging line of desalinators inside the transformation Plant. The water in this tank is transfered by electrical pumps to outside tanks, from where the fresh-water distribution is made by gravity to the citizen's homes.
 
 By simulating the level evolution, depending of what pump or pumps are transferring the water, we can know at what time we'll have high or low level and take the required measures. This way we can prevent overfill of fresh-water storage tank.
 
 How is it?
 
1 - Insert actual tank storage level in field: "Act. Level.", level must be beyond 400 to 1300 m3.

2 - Select the "Min" and "Max" desirable level.

3 - Put in the production flow value in field "RO" (The production for each units vary from 32 to 45 t/h).

4 - Select checkbox of pretended pump/pumps.

5 - Click Simulate button.
